        <b>Types of tests</b><br/>
        1. Unit Testing - testing small components in isolation from other components. Often performed by Developers.<br/>
        2. End To End (E2E) Testing - using code to identify how interface changes after an action is performed. For example, adding a new element; button is clicked. Focus - on end result.<br/>
        3. Manual testing - just like a user would experience. It is important to use different devices.<br/>
        4. Stress Testing - simulating heavy load in the app. See the performance.<br/>
        5. Test Driven Development - you are writing your tests during development, and not when you are done.<br/></br>
        <b>Karma</b> - JS Test Runner which will be used to run test in multiple browsers.<br/>
        <b>Jasmine</b> - JS Testing Framework. Does not depent on anything, so it can be used everywhere.<br/>
        <b>PhantomJS</b> - headless browser. Does not have GUI, - improves speed of running tests.<br/>
        <b>Protractor</b> - testing Framework build on Jasmine for End To End tests.
